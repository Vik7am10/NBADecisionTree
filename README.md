This repository contains the code, datasets, and analysis for the project "Predicting NBA Player Performance Using Decision Trees". The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models that predict player performance metrics like points, assists, and rebounds based on historical game data.

Project Highlights
Objective: Build an accurate and interpretable machine learning model to predict NBA player performance using decision trees and advanced boosting techniques.
Dataset: The project uses a dataset of over 668,000 player performance records, cleaned and preprocessed for high-quality analysis.
Key Features:
Player statistics: points, assists, rebounds, steals, etc.
Game context: opponent, game location, player position, etc.
Methods
Data preprocessing:
Handling missing values with imputation.
Feature scaling and standardization.
Feature engineering:
Creating meaningful features like player form, team strength, and opponent difficulty.
Machine Learning:
Implemented decision trees and gradient boosting (XGBoost).
Dimensionality reduction with PCA to extract principal components.
K-means clustering for identifying player archetypes.
Validation:
Used 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
Tuned hyperparameters to balance accuracy and prevent overfitting.
Results
Achieved a significant improvement in prediction accuracy with advanced ensemble methods.
Identified and analyzed player archetypes for strategic insights.
Created interactive visualizations, including player clusters and game impact heatmaps.
